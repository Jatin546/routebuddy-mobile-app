Created backend_test.py with full test coverage including: authentication (session exchange, user retrieval, logout), profile management (get/update/verify), route management (create/retrieve), discovery matching (Haversine algorithm), connections (request/accept/list), messaging (send/retrieve), and safety features (report/block). Test users created in MongoDB with proper session tokens. All endpoints responding correctly with proper data validation and error handling."
